@h1 NAME

cmus - C\* Music Player


@h1 SYNOPSIS

cmus [*options*]


@h1 DESCRIPTION

cmus is a small ncurses based music player.  It supports various output
methods by output-plugins. cmus has completely configurable keybindings and
can be controlled from the outside via *cmus-remote*(1).

@h1 OPTIONS

--listen ADDR
	Listen to ADDR (UNIX socket) instead of `$CMUS_SOCKET` or
	`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cmus-socket`.
	ADDR is either a UNIX socket or host[:port].

	*WARNING*: Using host[:port] is insecure even with password!
	It might be useful though in LAN if you want multiple local users to
	able to control cmus.  Never make cmus listen to the internet.

	NOTE: Don't use this option to run multiple instances as same user.
	That would corrupt the track metadata cache.

--passwd PASSWD
	Set the password for TCP/IP connections.  Must be set if you are listening
	from host[:port].  Used in conjunction with --listen.

--plugins
	List available plugins and exit.

--show-cursor
	Keep cursor always visible.  This is useful for screen readers.

--help
	Display usage information and exit.

--version
	Display version information and exit.


@h1 VIEWS

There are 7 views in cmus.  Press keys 1-7 to change active view.

Library view (1)
	Display all tracks in so-called *library*. Tracks are sorted
	artist/album tree.  Artist sorting is done alphabetically. Albums are
	sorted by year.

Sorted library view (2)
	Displays same content as view 1, but as a simple list which is
	automatically sorted by user criteria.

Playlist view (3)
	Displays editable playlists with optional sorting.

Play Queue view (4)
	Displays queue of tracks which are played next. These tracks are
	played before anything else (i.e. the playlist or library).

Browser (5)
	Directory browser.  In this view, music can be added to either the
	library, marked playlist or queue from the filesystem.

Filters view (6)
	Lists user defined filters.

Settings view (7)
	Lists keybindings, unbound commands and options.  Remove bindings with
	*D* or *del*, change bindings and variables with *enter* and toggle
	variables with *space*.

@h1 COMMAND LINE

Everything in cmus is implemented as commands which can be typed at command
line or bound to a key.  To enter command mode type *:*.  To execute a command
press *ENTER* or to cancel press *ESC* or *CTRL-C*.  Use up/down arrows to
browse command history.  Use *TAB* to complete commands and parameters, you can
tab complete almost anything.  You don't need to type full command names if the
command is unambiguous (no other commands starting with the same characters).

Examples:

	@pre
	# add files, short for ':add ~/music'
	:a ~/music

	# change output plugin
	:set output_plugin=oss

	# start playing
	# you could just press 'x' which is the default
	# binding for this command
	:player-play

	# clear current view (library, playlist or play queue)
	:clear
	@endpre


@h1 SEARCHING

Search mode works like the command mode, to enter search mode press */* and
then type the search words and press *ENTER*.  Press *n* to search next or *N*
to search previous match using the same search words.  Type *?* to search
backwards.

In views 1-4 words are compared to artist, album and title tags. Type
*//WORDS* or *??WORDS* to search only artists/albums in view 1 or titles in
views 2-4. If the file doesn't have tags words are compared to filename
without path.

Searching works in views 5-7 too and its logic should be pretty obvious.


@h1 PLAYLIST EDITING

@h2 Selecting Tracks

Editing commands affect the currently marked tracks or if there are no marked
tracks the currently selected track (or selected artist/album in view 1).

Mark selected track by pressing *SPACE*.  Marked tracks appear with a gray
background.  You can only mark tracks in the list views (2-4).

@h2 Copying Tracks Between Views

You can copy marked or selected tracks from views 1-5.

@li *a*
copy tracks to the library (1-2)

@li *y*
copy tracks to the marked playlist (3)

@li *e*
append tracks to the play queue (4)

@li *E*
prepend tracks to the play queue (4)

@h2 Moving Tracks

In views 2-4 you can move tracks within the list. Note that moving is
disabled if the view is auto-sorted (see *lib_sort* and *pl_sort* options).

Pressing *p* moves marked tracks to the position immediately after the
selected track.  *P* moves them to the position immediately before the
selected track.  If there are no marked tracks then the selected track is
moved down (*p*) or up (*P*).

NOTE: Changing active filters reloads view 2 so it isn't a good idea to
manually order tracks in the view.

@h2 Removing Tracks

Press *D* or *delete* to remove marked or selected tracks in the current view
(1-4).  The tracks will be removed immediately from the view without asking
for confirmation.  In the browser and filters views the same keys are used to
remove a file or filter (will ask for confirmation).


@h1 STATUS LINE

Right hand side of the status line (second row from the bottom, black text on
a grey background) consists of the following fields:

@pre
aaa_mode & play_sorted & play_library | continue follow repeat shuffle
@endpre

NOTE: *aaa_mode* and *play_sorted* will be displayed only if *play_library* is
*true* because these are meaningless when playing the playlists (view 3).

Pressing *m*, *o*, *M*, *C*, *r* and *s* keys should make it easier to
understand what all those fields mean.

See CONFIGURATION OPTIONS section for more information about these options.


@h1 KEYBINDINGS

Here's list of default keybindings.  See *unbind* and *bind* commands in the
COMMANDS section.

@h1 LIBRARY VIEW SORTING

The library view (the tree-like one; not the sorted library view, for which
the sorting is controlled by the user by setting lib_sort - see `CONFIGURATION
OPTIONS`), is sorted automatically by cmus using the information found in the
tagging information provided by the audio files.

Generally, in the library view cmus uses three levels of sorting: the first
level would be the artist name, the second one the album and finally the
actual track.

At first, cmus checks if the "filename" looks like an URL, if it does, the
item is given the special artist and album name *<Stream>*.

If it is a file, it is checked if the artist and album tags are set. If not,
cmus assigns the special name *<No Name>* for the unset tag.

As the first level, cmus sorts alphanumerically by the value of the artist
tag. (<Stream> and <No Name> will be used as if they where normal names.)
If a special sorting tag is available, it's value will be used instead.

For album names, alphanumerical sorting is not the primary method, though.
To decide, how the second level should be sorted, cmus looks at the date of
the first track of each album. Sorting is done from young to old. Of course,
if one artist happens to have more then one album from one year,
alphanumerical sorting will be used after sorting by date.

If the date header is not set, the album will be placed on top of the list (in
fact, the internal integer value for unset album tags is -1).

The method for third sorting level (the track) is very similar to album
sorting. First two numerical values are checked (discnumber and tracknumber).
If sorting is still ambiguous, sorting will be done alphanumerically by the
value of the track's `filename` (not track name!).

For simple albums, that is it. There is a special case, though. Albums, that
feature various artists, also known as samplers or compilations.

If a track belongs to a compilation is again decided by the existence and
value of special tagging information. First, it is checked if cmus should use
a special artist name (e.g.: `'Fatboy Slim'` for a DJ set). If so, that one
will be used instead of the real artist name.

If that special name tag is not set, cmus checks if another tag is
set. If that is the case, the album will be given the special artist
name *<Various Artists>*. Albums filed under *<Various Artists>* are sorted
alphanumerically by album name instead of by date.

That way, you do not end up with compilation tracks scattered around your
library view.

The problem with compilation tagging is, that there is no generic tag or
method, that can be regarded as a standard across all different formats,
supported by cmus.

For mp3, the special-name tag would be the id3v2 *TPE2* frame. The
mark-as-compilation tag is the *TCMP* frame (which is a user defined id3v2.3
frame, used at least by amarok and apple's iTunes[tm]).

For vorbis style tags (for example in ogg vorbis and flac files), the
special-name tag is *ALBUMARTIST* and the mark-as-compilation tag is
*COMPILATION*. Vorbis tags names are case insensitive.


@h1 COMMANDS

This section describes cmus' commands.  You can bind a key to any of these
commands, put these commands to configuration files and execute them in
command mode.  Also cmus-remote uses these commands in its protocol.

Optional parameters are in brackets, obligatory parameters in angle brackets
and default key bindings in parenthesis.

add [-l] [-p] [-q] [-Q] <file|dir|url|playlist>
	Add file/dir/url/playlist to the specified view or the current view.

	@li -l
	add to library

	@li -p
	add to playlist

	@li -q
	add play queue

	@li -Q
	prepend to play queue

	URL is a Shoutcast stream (http://...) or a CDDA URL (cdda://...)
	(see *PLAYING AUDIO DISCS*).

	Supported playlist: plain, .m3u, .pls.

bind [-f] <context> <key> <command>
	Add a key binding.

	@li -f
	overwrite existing binding

	Use tab to expand contexts, keys and commands.  Command is any command
	listed in this section.

	Valid key contexts
		common, library (1-2), playlist (3), queue (4), browser (5),
		filters (6)

	There's one context for each view.  Common is a special context on
	which bound keys work in every view.

	You can override specific keys in common context for a view.  For
	example *i* selects the current track in views 1-3 but in browser it
	is overridden to toggle showing of hidden files.

	When setting custom bindings in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/rc`, it is
	recommended to use the -f option, or else bind may fail due to an
	existing binding in the autosave or system-level config files.

browser-up (*backspace*)
	Change to parent directory in browser view (5). This command only
	makes sense to be bound to the *browser* key context although it's
	possible to use this even if browser view is not active.

cd [directory]
	Changes the current working directory.  Changes the directory
	displayed in browser view too.

clear [-l] [-p] [-q]
	Remove all tracks from the specified view or the current view.

	@li -l
	clear library

	@li -p
	clear playlist

	@li -q
	clear play queue

colorscheme <name>
	Change color scheme.  Color schemes are found in `/usr/share/cmus/` or
	`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/` and have .theme filename extension.

echo <arg>...
	Display arguments on the command line.

	If the arguments contain *{}* it is replaced with file name of the
	first selected track.

	NOTE: unlike with *run* the *{}* is replaced with only the first
	selected filename.

	Default bindings:

		@pre
		common  I   echo {}
		common  ^C  echo Type :quit<enter> to exit cmus.
		@endpre

factivate <user-defined-filter>...
	Select and activate the given user defined filters (displayed in the
	filters view).  Filter names are separated by spaces.  This command is
	mostly useful when bound to a key, to change active filters very
	quickly.  If no arguments given then all filters are unactivated.

	If you prefix a filter name with "!" then the filter value is negated
	before activation.

filter <filter-expression>
	Use this command when you want to temporarily filter contents of the
	library views without having separately define (fset) and activate the
	filter.  The filter is not saved.

fset <name>=<filter-expression>
	Define (or replace existing) filter and add it to filters view (6).

invert
	Invert the marking of tracks in playlist and queue views. See *mark*
	and *unmark*.

live-filter <simple-filter-expression|short-filter-expression>
	Use this command when you want to temporarily filter contents of the
	library views without having separately define (fset) and activate the
	filter.  The filter is not saved.

load [-l] [-p] <playlist>
	Load a playlist to the specified view or to the current view.

	@li -l
	load to library views

	@li -p

	Skip to the next track.

player-pause (*c*)
	Toggle pause.

player-pause-playback
	Pause if currently playing.

player-play [filename] (*x*)
	Play the given track, or, if none is specified, [re]play the current
	track from the beginning.

player-prev (*z*)
	Skip to the previous track.

player-stop (*v*)

	This command can only be bound to a key but not used in the command
	line directly.

pwd
	Prints the current working directory.

refresh (*^L*)
	Redraw the terminal window.

run <command>
	Run command for the marked tracks OR the selected one if none marked.

	By default file names are appended to the command.  If the command
	contains *{}* it is replaced with list of filenames.

	NOTE: In view 1 you can run a command for all files in the selected
	album or artist.

save [-e]  [-l] [-L] [-p] [-q]  [file]  (*:w*)
	Save the specified view's or the current view's contents to a playlist
	file. In extended mode (-e), also save metadata.

	@li -l
	save library views

	@li -L
	save filtered library views

	@li -p
	save playlist view

	@li -q
	save queue view

	If no filename given the old filename is used. "-" outputs to stdout
	(works only remotely).

	independently.

	To increase or decrease volume prefix the value with *-* or *+*,
	otherwise value is treated as absolute volume.

	Both absolute and relative values can be given as percentage units

`standout` makes the text standout.

`bold` makes the text bold.

`reverse` reverses the text colors.

`underline` underlines the text.

`blink` makes the text blink.

@h2 Format Strings

Format strings control display of tracks in library, playlist and play queue
views.

NOTE: *altformat_\** options are used when there are no tags available.

Special Keys:

	%=
		start align right (use at most once)
	%%
		literal *%*
	%?
		literal *?*

You can use printf style formatting (width, alignment, padding). As an
extension, the width can have a %-suffix, to specify a percentage of the
terminal width. @br
To see current value of an option type *:set option=<TAB>*.

Note: With %{bitrate}, you'll have to append the unit yourself, as mentioned
in the example below.

You can use conditional operator *%{?CONDITION?A[?B]}*.
CONDITION has the same syntax as `filters`, except for unsupported short and
simple expressions and supported keys comparison (e.g. artist=albumartist).
Its keys are:
	format strings' special keys @br
	configuration options @br
	keyword *stream* [boolean] (returns true if track is a stream) @br
	keyword *va* [boolean] (returns true if track's album is compilation)
Else part can be skipped. A and B can contain string literals in *"* or *'*.
A and B can be empty.

Examples:

	@pre
	:set format_trackwin= %02n. %t %{?y?(%y)}%= %d
	:set format_current= %n. %-30t %40F (%y)%= %d
	:set format_current= %a - %l - %02n. %t%= %{bitrate}Kbps %g %y
	:set format_playlist= %f%= %6{rg_track_gain} dB  %8{rg_track_peak}
	:set format_playlist= %-25%a %-15%l %3n. %t%= %y %d
	@endpre

@h2 Sort Keys

Sort option (lib_sort, pl_sort) value is space separated list of the following
sort keys:

	artist, album, title, tracknumber, play_count, discnumber, date,
	originaldate, genre, comment, albumartist, filename, filemtime, bpm,
	bitrate, codec, media, codec_profile, rg_track_gain, rg_track_peak,
	rg_album_gain, rg_album_peak

Note: Adding a '-' in front of the key will sort in reverse order


@h1 PLUGIN OPTIONS

dsp.alsa.device
	PCM device for ALSA plugin, usually "default".

mixer.alsa.channel
	Mixer channel for ALSA Plugin, usually "pcm", "master" or "headphone".
	To see all possible values run "alsamixer" or "amixer".

mixer.alsa.device
	Mixer device for ALSA plugin, usually "default".

mixer.pulse.restore_volume
	Restore the volume at startup using PulseAudio. Otherwise, cmus sets
	the volume to 100%, which does not mix well with "flat volumes"
	feature of PA. Defaults to "1"; set to "0" to turn off.

dsp.ao.buffer_size
	Buffer size, default is 16kB (but you may want to try bigger values if
	you experience buffer under-runs).

dsp.ao.device_interface
	Device interface for libao plugin to request a specific playback
	device/sink/output.  This name will be in a format determined by the
	specific driver backend.

dsp.ao.driver
	Output driver for libao plugin.  Example values: "alsa09", "esd",
	"irix", "oss", "sun", "aixs", "wav".

	NOTE: of the file output drivers only "wav" is supported.

dsp.ao.wav_counter
	Counter used for making filename.  Used only if *dsp.ao.driver* is
	"wav".  For example if this is 1 and *dsp.ao.wav_dir* is "/home/user"
	then PCM data is outputted to "/home/user/01.wav".  This counter is
	incremented every time playback is stopped.

	NOTE: you probably want to set *continue* to *false* (press *C*),
	otherwise playback is not stopped between tracks and all PCM data is
	outputted to one wav file (useful if you want to join files).  Also
	unsetting shuffle and repeat might be good idea.

dsp.ao.wav_dir
	Output directory for libao plugin, default is your home directory.
	Used only if *dsp.ao.driver* is "wav".

dsp.coreaudio.device
	Device for Core Audio output. Leave empty for default.

dsp.coreaudio.enable_hog_mode
	Set true to set the device to hog mode. The default value is false.

dsp.coreaudio.sync_sample_rate
	Synchonize the device sample rate with the player, so no interpolation
	will be applied to the stream.

dsp.jack.server_name
	Connect to jackd with this name. Leave empty for default.

dsp.jack.resampling_quality
	Sets the quality of the re-sampling. 0 is low quality but fast, 1 is
	medium quality, 2 (default) is high quality but more CPU intensiv. This
	option is only available if cmus was compiled with libsamplerate
	support.

input.cdio.cddb_url
	CDDB URL (default: freedb.freedb.org:8880). Use HTTP protocol if prefixed
	with "http://" (e.g.: http://freedb.musicbrainz.org:80/~cddb/cddb.cgi).
	Set to an empty string to disable CDDB lookup completely.

input.\*.priority
	Sets the priority of the input plugin. If multiple plugins can play a
	file, the plugin with the higher priority is chosen. If the priority is
	0, the plugin is disabled.

dsp.oss.device
	PCM device for OSS plugin, usually /dev/dsp.

mixer.oss.channel
	Mixer channel for OSS Plugin, "pcm" or "master".

mixer.oss.device
	Mixer device for OSS plugin, usually /dev/mixer.

dsp.roar.server
	Address of RoarAudio server. Defaults to internal defaults.
	Can be UNIX, TCP/IP or DECnet address.

dsp.roar.role [music, background_music, ...]
	Role for stream. May be used by the server to apply additional
	defaults.

dsp.sun.device
	PCM device for Sun plugin, usually /dev/audio.

mixer.sun.channel
	Mixer channel for Sun Plugin, usually "master".

mixer.sun.device
	Mixer device for Sun plugin, usually /dev/mixer.

@h1 PLAYING AUDIO DISCS

With the cdio input plugin enabled, it is possible to play Audio CDs and CD
images. Just set the *device* option to either a device file (e.g. /dev/cdrom)
or an image file (e.g. ~/cd.cue). Then add a new track using the CDDA URL
scheme, e.g.:

	:add cdda://2

To add the whole disc, use cdda:// (without track number). This is currently
only working for audio discs, not images. Adding track ranges is also possible
(cdda://1-3). To add images without changing the device option, it is possible
to include the image path in the URL, e.g.:

	:add cdda:///path/to/cd.cue/2-5

The metadata will be read from CD-Text, and if not available, looked up from
a CDDB server (see *input.cdio.cddb_url*).


@h1 FILTERS

Filters are used mostly for filtering contents of library views (1 & 2).
Filters do not change the actual library content, i.e. *:save* command will
still save all tracks to playlist file whether they are visible or not.

@h2 Types

There are three types of filter expressions, each offering more
expressiveness:

	@li *simple*
	`e.g.` beatles

	@li *short*
	`e.g.` ~a beatles (!~y1960-1965 | ~d>600)

	@li *long*
	`e.g.` artist="\*beatles\*"&album="R\*"

Simple expressions are only available using *live-filter*. For other
filter commands the type is auto-detected, so both short and long
expressions can be used.

Long expressions are lists of built-in filters or user defined filters
separated with *&* (and) or *|* (or).  Parenthesis can be used group
subexpressions and *!* negates result of the expression following it.
Same is true for short expressions, but they can only be made of
built-in filters. Also (and)-grouping is done implicitly.

@h2 Strings

@li long
*filename*, *artist*, *albumartist*, *album*, *title*, *genre*, *comment*,
*codec*, *codec_profile*, *media*
@br
Comparators: *=* and *!=* (not equal)

@li short
*~f*, *~a*, *~A*, *~l*, *~t*, *~g*, *~c*
@br
Comparators: none

@h2 Integers

@li long
*discnumber*, *tracknumber*, *date* (year), *originaldate* (year), *duration*
(seconds), *bitrate*
@br
Comparators: *<*, *<=*, *=*, *>=*, *>*, *!=*

@li short
*~D*, *~n*, *~y*, *~d*
@br
Comparators: *<*, *>*
@br
Ranges: *a-b* (>=a&<=b), *-b* (<=b), *a-* (>=a)

@h2 Booleans

*tag* (true if track has tags), *stream* (true if track is a stream)
@br
For short expressions: *~T* and *~s*

@h2 Defining Filters

Filters can be defined with *fset* command.  User defined filters appear in
the filters view (6).

Create a new filter which name is *ogg* and value *filename="\*.ogg"*
	:fset ogg=filename="\*.ogg"

Filter ogg and mp3 files from the 90s. Note the use of user defined filter
*ogg*
	:fset 90s-ogg-mp3=date>=1990&date<2000&(ogg|filename="\*.mp3")

@h2 Activating Filters

*factivate* changes visible contents of the library (views 1-2).

Activate user defined filters *ogg* and *missing-tags*
	:factivate ogg missing-tags

Like above but negate value of *ogg* filter.
	:factivate !ogg missing-tags

Alternatively you can select the filters by pressing *space* in view 6 and
then activate the selected filters by pressing *enter*.

@h2 Throw-away Filters

*live-filter* and *filter* commands are useful when you want to use a filter only
once and not save it.  It changes visible contents of the library (views 1-2).
*filter* unactivates all filters in the filters view, while *live-filter* is
applied in addition to all currently activated filters.

Filter all rock (anything with *rock* in genre tag) music from 80s-
	:filter date>=1980&genre="\*rock\*"
	@br
	:filter ~y1980-~grock

Filter all artists/albums/titles containing "sleepwalking"
	:live-filter sleepwalking

@h2 Selecting Tracks Matching a Filter

Mark (select) all tracks with duration less than 2 minutes
	:mark duration<120

Mark (select) all tracks which have been played at least once
	:mark play_count>=1

These commands work in views 2-4.


@h1 FILES

cmus reads its configuration from 3 different places.

`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/autosave`
	This is the first file cmus loads.  cmus saves its state on exit to
	this file so you shouldn't edit it.

`/usr/share/cmus/rc`
	If the autosave file didn't exist, this file is read instead.

`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/rc`
	Static config file. This file is read immediately after the autosave
	file, and is never modified by cmus.  You can override auto-saved
	settings in this file.  This file is not limited to options, it can
	contain other commands too.

@h2 Color Schemes

There are some color schemes (\*.theme) in `/usr/share/cmus`.  You can switch
them using the *:colorscheme* command.  You can put your own color schemes to
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus.

@h2 Examples

Example status display script (See *status_display_program* option) can be
found in `/usr/share/doc/cmus/examples`.


@h1 ENVIRONMENT

CMUS_CHARSET
	Override cmus character set (default: \`locale charmap\`).

CMUS_HOME
	Override cmus config directory (default: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus).

CMUS_SOCKET
	Override cmus socket path (default: $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cmus-socket).

HOME
	Full path of the user's home directory.

http_proxy
	URI of the proxy to use for HTTP requests.

USER
	Name of the user running cmus.

USERNAME
	Fallback for *USER*.

@h1 D-Bus Interface (MPRIS)

cmus provides a D-Bus interface following the Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification (MPRIS) v2:
	https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/
